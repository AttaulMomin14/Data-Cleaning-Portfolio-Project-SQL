# Data-Cleaning-Portfolio-Project-SQL

I started this project by converting the data type of a column from Date/Time to Date.

Next Step: Filling the NULL values in the column by using Self-Join

Next Step: Splitting the Address Column into Multiple Columns using various String Functions like 'Substring', 'CharIndex', 'Len', 'ParseName'.

Next Step: Removing Duplicates by using CTE (Common Table Expressions) and Row_Number() Function.

Next Step: Altering and Updating the required columns.
